## Project Overview

Healthcare organizations face growing pressure to understand the financial impact of patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and regional variations. This project uses an Excel-driven analytics approach to uncover insights from a synthetic healthcare dataset containing:

- Age  
- Sex  
- BMI  
- Number of dependent children  
- Smoker status  
- Region  
- Total healthcare charges  

The Excel file includes **raw data**, **pivot-style analysis sheets**, and a **KPI dashboard** designed to replicate real analytics reporting used in healthcare operations and finance teams.

##  Workbook Structure

### **1. Hospital_Costs (Raw Data)**
A clean, structured dataset formatted for pivot-table and dashboard analysis.  
Contains 10 representative rows with demographic and financial variables.

### **2. Avg_Charges_by_Region**
A pivot-style analysis that calculates the average healthcare charge per region.  
This helps identify **geographic differences in cost** and potential regional risk factors.

### **3. Avg_Charges_by_Smoker**
Breaks down average charges between **smokers vs. non-smokers**.  
This analysis highlights cost impacts tied to lifestyle risk factors.

### **4. BMI_Charges_by_Sex**
Summarizes average BMI and average charges for **male vs. female** patients.  
Useful for understanding relationships between demographic characteristics and spending.

### **5. Dashboard (KPI Summary)**
A clean, executive-style KPI dashboard containing:
- **Total Charges**
- **Average Charge per Patient**
- **Total Patient Count**

This tab provides a high-level financial overview for quick decision-making.

##  Key Insights

From the dataset and pivot-style analysis, the following insights were identified:

### **1. Region Matters**
Some regions show significantly higher average healthcare charges, reflecting disparities in cost of care, risk factors, or healthcare utilization patterns.

### **2. Smokers Have Higher Costs**
Lifestyle risk factors—especially smoking—show a clear increase in total healthcare charges.  
This mirrors real-world healthcare spending patterns.

### **3. BMI and Demographics Influence Cost**
Variation in BMI and demographic characteristics correlates with cost differences, offering insights into patient health profiles and potential intervention opportunities.

### **4. KPI Summary Enables Quick Decision-Making**
The dashboard provides fast visibility into overall spending and utilization patterns, an essential tool for financial and operational leadership in healthcare settings.
